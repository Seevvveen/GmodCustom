X = 0              #
Y = 255            ##Defines the XYZ Varibles
Z = 0              #

B = vec(X,Y,Z)     #Defines B using the vec(0,255,0)


#You can define the number in vectors mutiple ways with examples such as;
#B = vec(1+1,2*2,3/3)   #Mathmatical Operations
#B = vec(X,Y,Z)         #Varibles
#B = vec(X+1,Y*2,Z/3)   #Combinations


##########
#Two Dimensional Vector (X,Y)
#Defined as A:vector2

A = vec2(X,Y)     #Defines A as a vec2

#Because both A and B are vector datatypes you can combine them
#B = vec(vec2(X,Y),Z)

#OR because A is defined as a vec2 we can also do;

#B = vec(A,B)


###########
#Four Dimensional Vector (W,X,Y,Z) 

C = vec4(W,X,Y,Z)   #defines C as a Vector4

#combining vectors still works meaning we can rewrite line 35 as;
#C = vec4(A,W,Z)    
    #NOTICE: We had to put varible A infront of W and Z, since we are defining our vector4 with another vector..
    #..We need to put that varibles first then follow the W X Y Z layout
    
#other coombinations examples are;
#C = vec4(A,A)  #2 vector2's 
#C = vec4(B,W)  #a vector plus a W


###########
#Taking Values from vectors

B = vec(100,50,25)

X = B:x()   #
Y = B:y()   ##Takes the Values from the vector assigned to B 
Z = B:z()   #


###########
#Dealing with decimals (often found when using vectors)

B = floor(vec(100/3,50/3,25/3))   #"floor" Forces the result to round down
B = ceil(vec(100/3,50/3,25/3))    #"Ceil" or Celing Forces the result to round up
B = round(vec(100/3,50/3,25/3))   #"round" Rounds like normal math rounds down anything less than 5 and up if 5 or more


#Vectors to Strings
print(B:toString())   #Takes the varible B which is a vector and converts it to a string then prints it

#Getting Random Numbers
B = floor(randvec(0,255))   #will call a random number between 0 & 255 then floor these values

#Interval Command
interval(100)   #Will update the E2 chip every (ammount) of ticks
