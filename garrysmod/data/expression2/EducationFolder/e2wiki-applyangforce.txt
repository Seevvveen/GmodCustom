    #1 Get the target angle and multiply by the speed you want to get it there
    #2 Subtract the Angle Velocity to prevent prop from overshooting, Makes prop slow down before reaching target
    
    #3 Mutiply by interia  
        #Since interia is given as a vector it must be shifted to the left so that the values align with the angles
        #The Y axis controls the pitch
        #The Z Controls Yaw
        #The X Controls Roll
