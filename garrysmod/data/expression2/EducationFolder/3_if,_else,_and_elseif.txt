#Whenever the condition in the if statement's () then execute the code between the {}

if(~A) {           #If there is a change in A execute {...}
    
}


if(A == 1) {       #If A equals 1 execute {...}
    
}

#A = 1 Assigns the Varible A the number 1, One equal sign ASSIGNS
#A == 1 Checks to see if A does equal 1, two equal signs means EQUALS

##########
#If Else statements, If the condition is met run the code, if its not it moves to the "else" part then run the code between {}

if(A == 1) {
    X = 1        
}                #
                 ##This IF Else Statement checks if A is equal to 1, if it is make X equal 1, If its not Make X equal 0
else {           #
    X = 0
}

#########
#ELSEIF statements means if the above IF statement is NOT met AND the condition in the () is met then run code between {}

if(A == 1) {
    X = 1        
}    
                      #
elseif(B == 1) {      ##This IF statement checks for A to be equal to one, IF "A" is not equal to 1 AND "B" is equal to 1 then run the code in {}
    Y = 1             #
}
     
else {         
    X = 0
    Y = 0
}

#Important to remeber the order of operations of IF statements, If A == 1, then the code will not check the else if statement below it
    #NOTICE: that means if you activate B FIRST and then activate A both will work
    #Also note if both are 1, A cannot be turned off until B is also turned off

#The most simple way to get past this for this section of code would be to seperate the two and give both A and B there on IF Else Statements

if(first | duped()) {           #very common, IF the E2 is running for the first time OR is pasted Execute the code
