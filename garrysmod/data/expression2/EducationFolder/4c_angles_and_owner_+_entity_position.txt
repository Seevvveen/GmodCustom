#getting the chip position

Chip_pos = entity():pos()   #this assigns the entity's position vector to the varible Chip_pos

Cx = round(Chip_pos:x())    #
Cy = round(Chip_pos:y())    ## Takes the XYZ values, rounds them, then assigns them to their Varibles
Cz = round(Chip_pos:z())    #

#Getting Owners postition

Owners_pos = owner():pos()

Ox = round(Owners_pos:x())  #
Oy = round(Owners_pos:y())  ## Takes the XYZ values from the the owners vector and assins it to varibles
