            so basically perf can only be a number between 0 and 100
            and what it does is it checks if the e2s tick quota is more than the tick quota limit 
            it also runs a check if the e2s perf is greater than or equal to the hard quota limit
            if you set perf to 100 then itll check if the e2s limit is greater than or equal to the soft limit * 2
            if its less than 99 then itll only check up to the limit you set
            
            TOO LONG DIDNT READ: IT RUNS CHECKS FOR THE SOFT AND HARD QUOTA LIMIT
            IF IT HITS THOSE LIMITS, RETURN 0, IF NOT THEN RETURN 1
        ]# 
    }
}
