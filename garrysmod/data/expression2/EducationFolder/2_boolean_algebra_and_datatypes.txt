#Uncomment each line of code to test their functions 

#D = A & B            ## & = AND, A and B need to be pressed for D to equal 1

#D = A | B | C        ## | = OR, A or B or C need to be pressed for D to equal 1

#D = !A               ## ! = NOT, When A equals 1, D equals 0, A should not be pressed for D to equal 1

if(~A) {              ## ~ = CHANGE (sometimes refered to as delta), Whenever the value of A changes D = 10
    D = 10

#datatypes are normally defined as a type of a number

#A = 10               ## Datatype is a number

#A:vector             ## A's datatype is now a vector, NOTE: when defining a datatype it needs to be defined in one of the @inputs or @persist Sections
#A = vec(0,0,0)       ## This Sets A to the vector "0 0 0" refering to the "X Y Z" cordinates of the world

#A:entity()           #
#A:angle()            ##More examples of Datatypes
#A:string             #

#You cant mismatch datatypes, If A is a number and B is a vector, A CANNOT equal B
